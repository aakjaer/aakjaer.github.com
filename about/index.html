                <p class="lead">Besides being a big design fan, I'm also an outdoorsman, entrepreneur, sports geek, vivid kitesurfer and in general enjoy the simple pleasures in life.</p>

        <h3 class="group-heading">What I do</h3>
        <p>I have 15+ years of experience designing user-interfaces for web and mobile applications, usually in the role of Senior Product Designer (or whichever label the industry deems fashionable at that given point).</p>

        <p>My career was initially focused solely on design, but quickly moved on to writing front-end templates and eventually turned into a combined role of design and front-end implementation, filling the gap between the design team and programmers.</p>

        <p>These days, having a deep understanding of front-end practices and limitations, makes my job as a designer a lot more efficient, and usually leads to a leaner design- and implementation lifecycle.</p>

        <p class="quote">During the last 6-7 years I have gradually transitioned into a clean product designer role, spanning all the way from discovery and research, user-testing, through planning, prototyping, to designing and spec'ing for front-end handovers.</p>

        <p>I strive for high quality, simplicity and take pride in what I do, while making an effort to influence and inspire colleagues and people around me. By heart I am team player and love working with great minds who push me to do deliver my best, but I am also very comfortable making crucial decisions and executing projects on my own.</p>

        <h3 class="group-heading">Location</h3>
        <p>I am a firm believer in letting people choose to work where they are most efficient. Personally I prefer a mix of remote and on-site work, to find new inspiration from start-up vibe co-working offices, cafes etc. For the last 10 years I have travelled extensively and had the privilege of living in multiple countries, while working remotely for my Danish clients, learning valuable lessons about remote work, before it became mandatory for more or less everyone in 2020. Therefor I feel super confident working from wherever I am, knowing I can keep my productivity and motivation high for long periods of time.</p>

        <p>I am currently situated in Copenhagen which is still my home hub.</p>
