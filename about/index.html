                <p>I believe a deep understanding of the users and their needs we aim to meet, is absolutely crucial for the success of
                    any digital product. Anyone who has ever experienced the painful and costly results of a process based heavily on
                    assumptions and “expert knowledge”, resulting in poor user adoption, usability and market-fit, knows why these steps
                    matter so much.</p>
                <p>I use design frameworks such as User-centered Design and Design Thinking, to mitigate this risk, and make sure
                    everyone is working on and solving the right problems, while balancing user needs and business requirements.</p>

                <p>As a product designer, I feel responsible for every detail of a products life-cycle, from usability,
                    accessibility,
                    interactions and performance, to composition, layout and typography.</p>
                <p>I use various methods and tools to move low-fidelity designs to the final UI, depending on the complexity of the
                    project, but always strive to design effective, easy-to-use and high-quality products.</p>

                <p>When designing, I constantly try to incorporate my knowledge about front-end development, and try to minimize the
                    challenges the developers will face when implementing the design. I work closely with developers throughout the
                    process, to further understand possibilities and limitations and make sure designs are feasible, both from a front-
                    and back-end perspective.</p>

                <p>I am a firm believer in letting people choose where they are most productive - to some extent even when they work. I
                    don’t fit into many of societies boxes, and I don’t expect everyone else to do so either. When possible, I prefer a
                    hybrid work model, combining remote and on-site work. I think getting together physically as a team is super
                    important, but I also know how busy people are, especially those with kids, and I prefer a happy well-balanced team,
                    over 5 day forced office attendance.</p>
                
                <h4 class="group-heading">Staying productive</h4>
                <p>During the past 12 years I have travelled extensively and had the privilege of living in multiple countries and
                    cities (San Francisco Bay Area, Chiang Mai and St. Vincent), while working remotely for my Danish clients. I learned
                    valuable lessons about remote work, before it became more or less mandatory for everyone during the pandemic in
                    2020, and has made me confident working from wherever I am, knowing I can keep my productivity and motivation high
                    for long periods of time.</p>
