        <h1 class="display-heading mb-5">How I work</h1>
        <p class="lead mb-5 pb-5">With 20+ years experience in both UX/UI design and front-end development, I bring a <strong>unique blend of visual craft and technical skill</strong> to a team. I own end-to-end product design, and have experience with B2B SaaS, heavy back-office projects, consumer facing websites and mobile apps.</p>
        
        <h3 class="group-heading">Research</h3>
        <p>I believe a deep understanding of the users and their needs we aim to solve, is absolutely crucial for the success of any digital product. Anyone who has ever experienced the painful and costly results of a process based heavily on assumptions and “expert knowledge”, resulting in poor user adoption, usability and market-fit, knows why these steps matter so much.</p>
        <p>I use design frameworks such as User-centered Design and Design Thinking, to mitigate this risk, and make sure everyone is working on and solving the right problems, while balancing user needs and business requirements.</p>

            <p>As a designer, I feel responsible for every detail of a products life-cycle, from usability, accessibility, interactions and performance, to composition, layout and typography.</p>
            <p>I use various methods and tools to move low-fidelity designs to the final UI, depending on the complexity of the project, but always strive to design effective, easy-to-use and high-quality products.</p>

        <h3 class="group-heading">UX & UI design</h3>
        <p>As a designer, I feel responsible for every detail of a products life-cycle, from usability, accessibility, interactions and performance, to composition, layout and typography.</p>
        <p>I use various methods and tools to move low-fidelity designs to the final UI, depending on the complexity of the project, but always strive to design effective, easy-to-use and high-quality products.</p>
        <p>When designing, I constantly try to incorporate my knowledge about front-end development, and try to minimize the challenges the developers will face when implementing the design. I work closely with developers throughout the process, to further understand possibilities and limitations and make sure designs are feasible, both from a front- and back-end perspective.</p>

        <h3 class="group-heading">Hand-over</h3>
        <p>I have extensive experience delivering design hand-over to developers, either as specs directly in the design files, or as comprehensive tasks or user-stories, sharing context about user journeys, design intention.</p>

        <h3 class="group-heading">Collaboration</h3>
        <p>I am a team player by heart and love working with talented colleagues, who push me to perform my best. I take great pride in what I do and make an effort to influence and inspire colleagues and people around me. Due to my contractor background and my time in start-ups, I feel comfortable covering various roles, responsibility areas and executing autonomously with little oversight.</p>  

        <h3 class="group-heading">Tool box</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Figma, Tokens Studio</strong> - Admittedly, I do most of my work in Figma. but I have been around long enough to recognize that every tool, no matter how much we love it (Photoshop, Flash, Affinity Designer, Sketch, Abstract, XD, etc.), has an expiry date.</li>
            <li><strong>Notion, Google Docs, Things</strong> - structuring things, checklists</li>
            <li><strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> - for HTML, CSS and JS</li>
            <li><strong>Github, DevOps, BitBucket</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Google slides, Keynote</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Slack, Discord, Teams</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="group-heading">Gotchas</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Experience planning and building professional scale design systems, including design token setup as a shared single-source of truth, between designers and devs.</li>
            <li>Experience designing for web accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="group-heading">Work-life balance</h3>
        <p>I am a firm believer in letting people choose where they are most productive - to some extent even when they work. I
            don’t fit into many of societies boxes, and I don’t expect everyone else to do so either. When possible, I prefer a
            hybrid work model, combining remote and on-site work. I think getting together physically as a team is super
            important, but I also know how busy people are, especially those with kids, and I prefer a happy well-balanced team,
            over 5 day forced office attendance.</p>
        
        <p>During the past 12 years I have travelled extensively and had the privilege of living in multiple countries and
            cities (San Francisco Bay Area, Chiang Mai and St. Vincent), while working remotely for my Danish clients. I learned
            valuable lessons about remote work, before it became more or less mandatory for everyone during the pandemic in
            2020, and has made me confident working from wherever I am, knowing I can keep my productivity and motivation high
            for long periods of time.</p>
