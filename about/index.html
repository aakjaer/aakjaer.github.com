                <p>I have experienced the costly results of working based on assumptions and â€œexpert knowledge", leading to poor user adoption, sub-par usability and bad market-fit to name a few.</p>

                <p class="mb-0">When designing, I constantly try to incorporate my knowledge of frontend development, and aim to minimize the challenges developers face when implementing the design. <strong>I work closely with developers throughout the process</strong>, to further understand possibilities and limitations and make sure designs are feasible, from both a front- and back-end point of view.</p>

                <p>During my career I have traveled extensively and had the privilege of living in multiple countries and cities (San Francisco, Chiang Mai Thailand and St. Vincent), while working remotely for clients. I've learned valuable lessons about remote work, before it became more or less mandatory for everyone during the pandemic in 2020, and it has made me confident working from wherever I am, knowing I can keep my productivity and motivation high for long periods of time.</p>


                <p>Despite being highly dedicated to what I do professionally, I value my life outside work </p>


                <p><strong>When possible, I prefer a hybrid work model, combining remote and on-site work</strong>. I think getting together physically as a team is super important, but I also know how busy people are, especially those with kids, and I prefer a happy well-balanced team,over 5 day forced office attendance.</p>

                <p>I am a firm believer in letting people choose where they are most productive - to some extent even when they work. I donâ€™t naturally fit into many of societies boxes, and I donâ€™t expect anyone else to do so either.</p>
