                <p class="lead">I am a product designer with 15+ years of experience designing high-quality web- and mobile user-interfaces.</p>

                <p class="lead">I strive to design and build user-friendly, future-proof products which are easy maintainable and can be handed over to others.</p>

        <h3 class="group-heading">Summary</h3>

        <p>Early in my career I focused on pure digital design, but after a couple of years the front-end technologies caught my
            interest and I started writing templates and eventually transitioned into a combined role of designer and front-end
            developer, filling a gap between the product team and front-end developers.</p>


        <p class="quote">During the last 6-7 years I have gradually transitioned into a clean product designer role, spanning all  the way from discovery and research, user-testing, through planning, prototyping, to designing and spec'ing for front-end handovers.</p>

        <p>Having a deep understanding of front-end practices, makes my job designing the UI and defining the final front-end
        components a lot more efficient, and usually leads to a leaner design- and implementation lifecycle.</p>
        
        <p>I strive for high quality, simplicity and take pride in what I do, whether it involves UX/UI design, HTML/CSS or spec'ing front-end requirements. I make an effort to influence and inspire colleagues and people around me. I am team player by heart and love working with great minds who push me to do perform my best, but I am also very comfortable making crucial decisions and executing projects on my autonomously.</p>

        <p>I feel comfortable working directly with stakeholders, interviewing end-users or participating in a discovery/planning phase of a project.</p>

                <div class="text-muted mb-2 text-small text-uppercase">Jan 2021 → July 2021</div>
                <p>For big parts 2021 I lived and worked on a tiny island called <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/rtjskWDtpAqz5U9b9">Mayreau</a> in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, with a friend and business partner Kamran on a personal eco-resort project called Windward Project (our journey is documented on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CNDZBVNAwwIm5_E5PHusND0BX8iGRCcdX0oNEc0/">Kamran's Instagram page</a>).</p>
                    
                <p>In short (which is almost impossible), we have taken the first steps of creating a totally off-grid eco-resort using solar power, desalination for drinking water, eco-friendly custom-made prefab bungalows, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CNDZBVNAwwIm5_E5PHusND0BX8iGRCcdX0oNEc0/">augmented reality</a>, community programs and lot more!</p>
            </li>
        </ol>


        <h3 class="group-heading">Work-life balance</h3>
        <p>I am a firm believer in letting people choose to work where they are most efficient. Personally I prefer a mix of remote and on-site work, to find new inspiration from start-up vibe co-working offices, cafes etc.</p>
        <p>For the past 10 years I have travelled extensively and had the privilege of living in multiple locations (e.g. Chiang Mai, San Francisco and St. Vincent), while working remotely for my Danish clients, learning valuable lessons about remote work, before it became mandatory for more or less everyone in 2020. I therefor feel super confident working from wherever I am, knowing I can keep my productivity and motivation high for long periods of time.</p>

        <p>I am currently situated in my home hub, Copenhagen.</p>

        <p>Besides being a huge design nerd, I'm also training nerd, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLtV7CgLLkzzpt6Z3XzJLzzHf0cEWc6o5JzbzA0/">entrepreneur/thrill seeker</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BfprvVWHB73/">vivid kitesurfer</a>, <a href="https://goodreads.com/danielaakjaer">love reading</a> and enjoy <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B266tS9HaKk/">the simple pleasures of life.</a></p>
