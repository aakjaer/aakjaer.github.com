                    development, I bring a unique
                    blend of visual craft and technical skill to a team. I own end-to-end product design, and have experience with B2B
                    SaaS, heavy back-office projects, consumer facing websites and mobile apps.</p>

                <p>A deep understanding of the users and their needs we aim to meet, is absolutely crucial for the success of
                    any digital product. Anyone who has ever experienced the painful and costly results of a process based heavily on
                    assumptions and ‚Äúexpert knowledge‚Äù, resulting in poor user adoption, usability and market-fit, knows why these steps
                    matter so much.</p>
                <p>I use design frameworks such as User-centered Design and Design Thinking, to mitigate this risk, and make sure
                    everyone is working on and solving the right problems, while balancing user needs and business requirements.</p>

                <p>As a product designer, I feel responsible for every detail of a products life-cycle, from usability,
                    accessibility,
                    interactions and performance, to composition, layout and typography.</p>
                <p>I use various methods and tools to move low-fidelity designs to the final UI, depending on the complexity of the
                    project, but always strive to design effective, easy-to-use and high-quality products.</p>

                <p>When designing, I constantly try to incorporate my knowledge of front-end development, and try to minimize the
                    challenges developers face when implementing the design. I work closely with developers throughout the
                    process, to further understand possibilities and limitations and make sure designs are feasible, from both a front-
                    and back-end point of view.</p>

                    important, but I also know how busy people are, especially those with kids, and I prefer a happy well-balanced team,

                    valuable lessons about remote work, before it became more or less mandatory for everyone during the pandemic in
                    2020, and has made me confident working from wherever I am, knowing I can keep my productivity and motivation high
