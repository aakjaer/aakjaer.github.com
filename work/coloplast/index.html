                    <h5 class="heading-md mt-0">The challenge</h5>
                    <p>Coloplast was struggling to keep brand- and design consistency across its 100+ international websites for end-consumers
                    and healthcare professionals. Years of relying entirely on
                    agencies for UX/UI work, had resulted in a highly incoherent and outdated presence across all digital channels.</p>
                    
                    <p>Not only was this turning into a major maintenance and financial issue, hindering any further brand development. It was also
                    starting to affect how end users and even Coloplast itself perceived the brand.</p>

                    <h5 class="heading-md">Outcome</h5>
                    <p>Smaller release deadlines were met throughout the project, and a v1.0 of the Figma design system and
                        the frontend Node packages, were launched during the Summer of 2023.</p>

                    <h2 class="display-heading">Case description</h2>
                    <p>Before I joined Coloplast in 2022, there had already been a first stab at a POC of a design system, but sadly the
                    project was unsuccessful and put on hold.</p>

                    <p>I got on board after a round of “restructuring”, leaving non of the original team members to join the new
                        project. The
                        new project group consisted of mid-level management, product owners, a project manager, a design manager, a
                        release
                        train engineer, a frontend architect and myself.</p>
            
                    <h3 class="heading-md">Lessons from the past</h3>
                    <p>While going over the original POC, it seemed like a lot of good thoughts had gone into it, and they managed
                        to build a simple UI library in Figma, with a handful of key components. So what caused the project to fail?
                        The idea of a design system was initially suggested to management, after a research phase, and accepted
                        early on. But months after, when presenting a conceptual button frontend component in Figma as the result of their labor,
                        management lost their patience and the project was put on ice. Leading members of the new project team, had some
                        valuable insights to what went wrong:</p>
            
                    <ul class="nifty-list">
                        <li>They weren’t able to effectively convey the purpose, benefits and challenges of implementing a design
                            system to
                            stakeholders and management. Management simple didn’t understand what a design system is even after
                            months of work.</li>
                        <li>They didn’t provide a convincing vision and a roadmap of how to get there.</li>
                        <li>The POC didn’t provide any measurable impact or value.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="heading-md">Taking inventory</h2>
                    
                    <p>Everyone on the team was convinced a design system was the right solution, but we needed a new plan to get management
                        fully behind the project. And fast.</p>
                    
                    <p>We did two full-day workshops to set the direction for the project. One outcome was to focus on a full inventory of
                        the
                        existing websites and apps to:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="nifty-list">
                        <li>Map out existing design variations to better determine which parts to base the design system upon.</li>
                        <li>Identify UX patterns for e.g. authentication flows.</li>
                        <li>Identify and prioritize component candidates.</li>
                        <li>Map out colors, typography, spacing and much more.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Some of the high-level issues we identified during this initial phase:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="nifty-list">
                        <li>Limited support for accessibility. A legal requirement to support accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1) looming in
                            the horizon. Color contrast being a main concern.</li>
                        <li>Fragmented ownership of cross-product consistency and branding.</li>
                        <li>3rd party agency was responsible for UX and UI design, leading to design inconsistencies and ownership conflicts
                            between the internal product owners and external designers.</li>
                        <li>An inconsistent design process created friction with the developers, attempting to systemize things on the
                            frontend, contributing to an ever growing list of differences between designs and final products.</li>
                        <li>Fragmented, multi-generational frontend implementations made global updates and maintenance an almost
                            insurmountable task.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Examples of low-level issues identified:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="nifte-list">
                        <li>Inconsistent or incorrect use of brand colors in design files and on the frontend.</li>
                        <li>Inconsistent use of typography.</li>
                        <li>Scattered and inconsistent accessibility support.</li>
                        <li>No guidelines for designers, developers or stakeholders.</li>
                        <li>Design files inconsistently organized across teams and files leading to overhead time for cross-team designers and developers.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>We also carried out a thorough analysis of 10+ top design systems (e.g. Atlassian, IBM, Shopify, Pinterest, Google and more) for inspiration on scope and direction we wanted take.</p>

                    <p>Acknowledging that implementing an entire design system in an large organization was going to be a huge undertaking,
                    combined with palpable pressure from management to not repeat past mistakes, we set out to address several low-hanging
                    issues asap. We needed to prove that our team was capable of delivering small tangible improvements, while clearly
                    communicating the plan and building the larger system.</p>

                    <p>To address one of our core tasks - accessibility - early on, the design system team decided to focus on building and
                    rolling out a color system. Not only would it add value to the digital products and design teams by providing a
                    unambiguous way of working with colors. It would also address the upcoming legal requirement for WCAG 2.1 support, which
                    management had stakes in. Also, it would force us to get all the base systems up and running in order to push things
                    into production.</p>

                    <p>With a limited crew of only 2, the front-end architect and myself, started to plan and set up all the foundational systems required to release a color system. This included setup of the necessary servers, repos and file structure, defining naming conventions, setting up base files and layouts in Figma, testing design tokens and a lot more.</p>

                    <p>Coloplast had a limited set of brand colors, but we needed more granular control to cover the many color combinations for buttons, states, theming, etc. </p>

                    <p>Our team had grown with an additional designer and together we defined <strong>10 core palettes</strong>, focusing on accessibility, to form the foundation for the semantic and component level colors. This involved A LOT of testing, reviewing color models, researching best practices, refactoring, tweaking etc. (Thank you for staying in the fight <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mia-bak-winther/" target="_blank">Mia</a> 🙏🏻).</p>

                    <p>The semantic color layer and color roles (foreground, background, border, focus etc.) were added to bring purpose to color names, and simplify the number of colors available to designers. We tested a handful of different naming approaches on designers and developers to determine the best one.</p>
                        
                    <p>The intention was that this abstraction would make it a easier to choose colors, while putting up guardrails to make it harder for designers to go rogue. </p>

                    <p>For example, muted secondary text, would use the color <code>color.fg.muted</code>. Also we hoped it would help designers and
                    developers establish a shared language around colors in general.</p>
