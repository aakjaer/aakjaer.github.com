                <p>In short (which is not possible), we have taken the first steps of creating a totally off-grid eco-resort using solar power, desalination for drinking water, eco-friendly custom-made prefab bungalows, community programs and a lot more!</p>

        <h3 class="group-heading">Work-life balance</h3>
        <p>I am a firm believer in letting people choose where they are most productive - to some extent even when they work. I don’t fit into many of societies boxes, and I don’t expect everyone else to do so either. When possible, I prefer a hybrid work model, combining remote and on-site work. I think getting together physically as a team is super important, but I also know how busy people are, especially those with kids, and I prefer a happy well-balanced team, over 5 day forced office attendance.</p>

<p>During the past 12 years I have travelled extensively and had the privilege of living in multiple countries and cities (San Francisco Bay Area, Chiang Mai and St. Vincent), while working remotely for my Danish clients. I learned valuable lessons about remote work, before it became more or less mandatory for everyone during the pandemic in 2020, and has made me confident working from wherever I am, knowing I can keep my productivity and motivation high for long periods of time.</p>

<p>Besides being a design nerd, I’m a <a href="https://connect.garmin.com/modern/profile/dfa36e0f-72c7-4a2c-9268-ac6200593a51" target="_blank">devoted work-out nut</a>, <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/members/daniel-aakjaer-sorensen?ref=header" target="_blank">hiker</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CNEAOGCLNw3" target="_blank">adventure seeker</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BfprvVWHB73/" target="_blank">dedicated kite-surfer</a>, <a href="https://goodreads.com/danielaakjaer" target="_blank">enjoy listening to audiobooks</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B266tS9HaKk/" target="_blank">value the simple pleasures of life</a>.</p>
