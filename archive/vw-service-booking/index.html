        <p class="lead">The project involved redesigning and implement a prototoype of Volkswagen's service-booking form, to make service bookings smoother for mobile visitors, and to improve the total number of online service bookings.</p>
        <p>The old sign-up flow was a very traditional, fairly unstyled, corporate looking, and had way too many form fields, that I initially had to convince the client to optimize. My idea was to challange the existing somewhat conservative and restricted CI which Volkswagen is known for, while maintaining a calm and professional look/feel. Everything was build with a <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>/<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> prototype with a trace of JS.</p>
