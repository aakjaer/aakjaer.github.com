                    Servicelover's vision is to change the face of customer service, by letting customers focus on giving positive feedback to their service experiences.
                </p>
                <p>The plan is to build a community of people who appreciate and acknowlege good service experiences, and service providers who make an effort to provide the best possible experience to their customers.</p>
                <p>Servicelovers operate with concepts like "Service lovers" and "Service heroes". A Servicelover represents a user who loves to find, rate and encourage good service. A Servicehero is an employee focused on delivering excellent service.</p>
                <p>I was brought in to design a new digital identity to the existing proof-of-concept app and continue the following UX and UI work.</p>
