        <p class="lead">I had the privilege of working for Vivino, a danish start-up company situated in Copenhagen and San Francisco, specializing in delivering wine ratings, reviews and prices to the biggest wine community in the world, currently counting more than 35 mio. users.</p>        
        <p>My task was to help the Copenhagen based Vivino team build a new front-end for <a href="http://vivino.com">Vivino.com</a>. Back then their Android and iOS apps were generating a lot of traffic and new users (around 3 mio.), but the website had been down prioritised for quite a while, and needed a serious overhaul.</p>
        <p>The in-house designer, <a href="https://www.andreasweiland.com/">Andreas Weiland</a>, had already begun the process of designing the many pages and elements when I got on the team, so my role started out guiding and tweaking the designs in a direciton suited for web, by identifying reusable elements, streamlining typography, planning responsive behavior etc.</p>

                    Building the templates
                </h2>
                <p>To isolate my efforts and keep things simple, I started out by building the front-end as a static prototype in <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. This made it faster to iterate and implement the many changes with the designer, without constantly having the complexity of the backend code to deal with.</p>
