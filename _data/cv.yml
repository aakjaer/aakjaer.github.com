    period: "2015/04-2015-06"
    description: |
      <p>In an attempt to convert more visits to Volkswagen's website into service bookings, I was assigned to redesign the booking form from ground up, focusing on making things easier for VW's mobile visitors.</p>
      <p>My initial thought was to challange the existing somewhat conservative and restricted CI, while maintaining a calm and professional look/feel. Everything was build with a <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>/<a href="http://www.getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> prototype, with a minimum use of Photoshop.</p>

      <p>The massive custom build car dealer project, involving more than 300 websites, 17 car brands and multiple portal designs, I helped design and build in 2009, needed a design and functionality overhaul.

        <li>Updating form designs by consolidating and cleaning up the old ones, with the main purpose of having better conversion rates on key services.</li>
